my don't have a good idea about my final project. I think i will do a game about brick breaker. I find some brick breaker example here is [exmaple] (http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=birck+breaker&view=detailv2&qpvt=birck+breaker&id=EC10C2841540F942AD05C01A3F9C1FA1A4C304A3&selectedIndex=1&ccid=g%2fp2VsuC&simid=608016054356215472&thid=OIP.M83fa7656cb82f2092f4bcdd4fa2c655fo0&ajaxhist=0). It is so difficult for me. but I will try to it.
I have a plan about how to make a brick breaker with p5.js. brick breaker will a board rebound a ball,  the ball can break brick. if i have enough time, i will make when brick breaker
reward will go down.

first week, i will draw a static picture with p5.js. then i will write a mousemove function or keybroadmove. i don't know how p5.js work with keybroadmove.i will create a broad on this game, and i will create some birck, then i create a ball. Here is my  first step. 
second week, i wll run my function, if it work, i will make more detail in my brick breaker. if it is not work, i will finger out what happened with it.I will make the ball can move, broad and birck can rebound the ball, then i will add keybroad code with p5.js
last week, i will check my function out. making sure it is well. i will can add some reward on my function, like make longer broad, double ball and faster ball.
